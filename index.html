            <p>A Vector Approach to Implement Cryptographic Instructions in RISC V processor
                <br> 
                This project report presents the workflow and lliterature review of a Cryptographic
                Extension for RISC-V processors, aiming to augment the security features of em
               bedded systems. The RISC-V architecture, known for its open and modular design,
                provides an excellent platform for extending processor capabilities without compro
               mising efficiency. The cryptographic extension incorporates hardware accelerators
                for essential cryptographic algorithms, such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption,
                hash functions, and secure key management.
                The project begins with an in-depth exploration of cryptographic algorithms
                suitable for hardware acceleration, taking into account the constraints of embedded
                systems. The extension design is discussed, highlighting the integration of cryp
               tographic instructions into the RISC-V instruction set architecture. Implementation
                details, including the hardware description language (HDL) used and the synthesis
                process, are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the cryptographic
                extension.

            <p>Credit Card Fraud detection Using Random Forest Algorithm
                <br> 
                Credit card fraud has become a significant concern in the financial industry, 
                leading to substantial financial losses and compromised data security for both 
                individuals and organizations. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques 
                have emerged as a powerful tool for detecting fraudulent transactions. This abstract 
                explores the application of machine learning algorithms in credit card fraud detection, 
                highlighting their effectiveness, key methodologies, and ongoing advancements. 
                The primary objective of credit card fraud detection is to distinguish between 
                legitimate and fraudulent transactions in real-time, minimizing false positives and 
                ensuring the security of transactions. Machine learning models, such as logistic 
                regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural 
                networks, have been employed to analyze transaction data. These models leverage 
                features like transaction amount, merchant location, time of day, and transaction 
                frequency to identify anomalies that might indicate fraud. 
                This abstract also discusses the importance of feature engineering, model 
                validation, and data preprocessing in the development of effective fraud detection 
                systems. Additionally, it addresses the significance of imbalanced datasets and how 
                techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and the use of ensemble methods can 
                mitigate this issue. 
                Moreover, advancements in deep learning have ushered in the era of neural 
                networks and deep neural architectures, which have shown promising results in 
                detecting complex patterns and adapting to evolving fraud schemes. The integration of 
                unsupervised learning techniques, such as autoencoders and anomaly detection, has 
                further improved the accuracy and robustness of fraud detection systems.

            <p>Voice Control Wheel Chair
                <br>
                The project ”Voice-Controlled Wheelchair” aims to develop a wheelchair system that
                can be operated using voice commands. The project makes use of a microcontroller
                based system to make a vehicle which moves according to voice based com
                mands.Voice controlled automation devices are based on the processing of commands
                in the form of speech. This technology enables individuals with mobility impairments
                to control the wheelchair’s movement, direction, and basic functions through spoken
                instructions. The system utilizes speech recognition algorithms to convert spoken
                words into actionable commands, enhancing the independence and autonomy of users
                who may have difficulty using conventional manual controls. The project combines
                elements of robotics, signal processing, and human-computer interaction to create a
                functional and user-friendly voice-controlled wheelchair solution.The vehicle can find
                it’s application in acting as a base for a commercial voice controlled wheelchair with
                further technical improvements
